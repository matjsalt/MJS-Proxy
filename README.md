# MJS-Proxy

**TL;DR:** Set On/Off proxy on 127.0.0.1:8080 aiming to work with BurpSuite. Ctrl+Shift+A

You were looking for some bugs with BurpSuite, closed it, and wanna keep using Chrome... boom, no connection. Or shutted off your computer, later in the next session, opened Chrome, the same happened.

No more three-four steps to configure it, just one key combination.

**Installation:**

 1. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)
 2. Enable 'Developer Mode'
 3. Drag and drop the folder 'MJS Proxy' in that screen
 4. Enjoy your beginner learning steps a little more, like me.

*You're free to make the mods you want, or suggest improvements.(Maybe a new name?)*

**PD:** *The icon has a really nice animation...*
